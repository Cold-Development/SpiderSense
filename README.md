**SpiderSense** is a Minecraft Bukkit/Spigot plugin tailored for BoxPvP servers and other PvP-focused game modes where managing the presence of cobwebs is crucial. Cobwebs can be used strategically in PvP environments, but they can also clutter the game world and cause performance issues if not managed properly.

# üì¶ Features
- **Automatic Removal of Cobwebs:** Cobwebs placed by players are automatically removed after a specified delay, ensuring they do not stay in the game world longer than necessary.
- **Configurable Timer:** Set the delay before cobwebs are removed in seconds to suit the dynamics of your server. For example, a 5-minute delay can help balance gameplay without letting cobwebs linger too long.
- **Player Notifications:** Players receive a notification message when their cobwebs are removed, keeping them informed about the plugin's actions.
- **Server Restart Handling:** On server restart or shutdown, all cobwebs are automatically cleared, maintaining a clean and fair playing environment.
